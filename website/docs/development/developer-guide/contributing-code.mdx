# Contributing Code

The preferred way of contributing to the Deskulpt codebase is to fork the main
repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt), and then
submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) (a.k.a, PR).

## Building from Source

In the first few steps, we explain how to locally install and build Deskulpt, and how to
set up your Git repository.

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt):
   Click on the "Fork" button near the top of the webpage. This creates a copy under
   your GitHub account. See [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
   for more information regarding how to fork a repository.

2. Clone your fork of the Deskulpt repository to your local machine and add the
   `upstream` remote. This saves a reference to the main Deskulpt repository, which you
   can use to keep your repository synchronized with the latest changes upstream.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/Deskulpt.git  # add --depth 1 if connection is slow
   cd Deskulpt
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt.git
   ```

   Check that the `upstream` and `origin` remote aliases are configured correctly by
   running:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should have `origin` pointing to your fork and `upstream` pointing to the main
   Deskulpt repository.

3. Install the prerequisites of [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
   Once you finished the guide, you should have **Node.js** and **Rust** installed.

4. Install node dependencies. Note that Rust dependencies should be installed
   automatically when you build the project.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Start the development server. This will be slow for the first time as it needs to
   build the whole Rust backend. Subsequent runs will be significantly faster.

   ```bash
   pnpm tauri dev
   ```

6. Build the project. You can build the platform-specific executable or installer of
   Deskulpt by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm tauri build
   ```

   Refer to the printout of the command for the location of the built artifacts. You may
   also want to make a debug build that is not optimized but includes debug symbols and
   devtools:

   ```bash
   pnpm tauri build -- --debug
   ```

You should now have a working installation of Deskulpt, and your Git repository properly
configured. You can now start contributing to the project.

## Submitting Pull Request

Please make sure that you have completed the steps in the previous section before
continuing. The next steps will describe the process of modifying code and submitting a
pull request.

7. Synchronize your `main` branch with the `upstream/main` branch. See [the guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
   for more information regarding how to synchronize a fork.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

8. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix before making any changes. It is
   always good practice to keep your `main` branch clean and only use it for merging
   other branches.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b MY-FEATURE
   ```

9. Develop on your new branch, using Git for version control. You may be interested in
   [developers' API references](/category/references) which provide details about the
   codebase of Deskulpt. When you are done editing, add changed files using `git add`
   and then `git commit` to record your changes in Git. You may also push your changes
   to your fork with:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin MY-FEATURE
   ```

   This will create a new branch on your fork that is a copy of your local branch.

10. **(Optional but recommended)** Run quality checks and tests before submitting a pull
    request. You may refer to [quality assurance](#quality-assurance) for more
    information.

11. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
    to create a pull request from your fork to the main Deskulpt repository.

It is often helpful to keep your local feature branch synchronized with the latest
changes in the main Deskulpt repository. To do this:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Subsequently, you might need to resolve merge conflicts, for which you may refer to
[this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).

## Quality Assurance

Before submitting a pull request, it is recommended to run quality checks and tests to
ensure that your changes are in good shape. Deskulpt provides the following convenience
scripts to help you with this:

- **Formatting**: Run the formatter to ensure that your code is properly formatted, in
  consistency with the format of the codebase.

  ```bash
  pnpm format            # Check
  pnpm format -- --fix   # Automatic fix if possible
  pnpm format js         # Lint only the frontend
  pnpm format rs         # Lint only the backend
  pnpm format -- --help  # See more details
  ```

- **Linting**: Run the linters to check for code styling issues. This is useful to
  ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards.

  ```bash
  pnpm lint            # Check
  pnpm lint -- --fix   # Automatic fix if possible
  pnpm lint js         # Lint only the frontend
  pnpm lint rs         # Lint only the backend
  pnpm lint -- --help  # See more details
  ```

- **Testing**: Run the test suite to ensure that your changes do not break existing
  functionality. This is especially important for changes that affect the core
  functionality of Deskulpt.

  ```bash
  pnpm test rs           # Run all backend tests
  pnpm test rs bundler   # Run only backend tests that match the "bundler" pattern
  pnpm test rs -- --cov  # Also generate coverage report
  pnpm test -- --help    # See more details
  ```

Powered by [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), formatting and linting for the
frontend and formatting for the backend will be automatically run when you commit your
changes. You may bypass these checks by using the `--no-verify` (or `-n`) flag when
committing. However, quality check failures will still prevent your pull request from
being merged into the main repository, so it is recommended to fix issues early when
possible.
