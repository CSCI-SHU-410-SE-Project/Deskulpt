# Documentation

We are glad to accept any sort of documentation improvement. This includes API
documentation, guide improvements, examples, tutorials, and more.

## Building the Documentation

1. First of all, make sure that you have properly installed the [development version](./contributing-code#building-from-source)
   of Deskulpt. Then go to the `website/` directory where the documentation is held and
   install the documentation dependencies, in addition to the core dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd website
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server. This supports live-reloading, so in most cases you can
   see the changes you make in real-time:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Build and serve the documentation. The build step will generate the static files
   that can be served by a web server. The serve step will start a web server that
   serves the built documentation:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run serve             # Will use existing build
   npm run serve -- --build  # Will (re)build before serving
   ```

4. The [backend developer API references](https://csci-shu-410-se-project.github.io/Deskulpt/rustdoc/deskulpt/)
   are generated separately from the main documentation. It can be built by running:

   ```bash
   npm run rustdoc
   ```
