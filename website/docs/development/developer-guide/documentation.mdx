# Documentation

This is the documentation for contributors to Deskulpt.

## How to Contribute?

In general, to contribute to the repo, you should open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).

## Local Development of the Codebase

To develop Deskulpt locally, you can follow the steps below:

0. Prerequisites:

   You could follow the prerequisite of [Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites). You should also have a moderate level of understanding of Tauri app development as well. The following prerequisites should be installed once you finish the guide provided by Tauri:

   - Node.js
   - Rust

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd Deskulpt
   npm install
   ```

   Rust dependencies should be installed automatically when you build the project.

3. Start the development server:

   Tauri provides a development server that you can use to test your application. You can start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build the project:

   You can build platform-specific executable and installer of Deskulpt by running:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Local Development of the Documentation

To develop the documentation locally, you can follow the steps below:

0. Prerequisites:

   The documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is written with Markdown (or MDX if you are familiar with JSX as well).

   You only need follow the [Node.js prerequisite setup guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#nodejs) provided by Tauri. Note that you don't need rust or tauri to contribute to the documentation.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd Deskulpt/website
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   Docusaurus provides a development server that you can use to test your documentation. You can start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

4. Build the project:

   You can build the documentation by running:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   To serve the build documentation, you can run:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
