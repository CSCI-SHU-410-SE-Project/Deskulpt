# Introduction

**Deskulpt** is a cross-platform desktop customization tool that allows you to write
React code to define [widgets](#what-are-widgets) on your desktop. It is powered by
[Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), with its backend written in Rust and frontend written
in TypeScript.

## What are Widgets?

If you are familiar with [React](https://react.dev/), a widget is simply a [React
functional component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component), each being wrapped
in some container and displayed on your desktop. Widgets can be anything from a simple
text display to a complex interactive application: essentially almost anything you can
do with React, under certain security restrictions imposed by Deskulpt.

## Design Principles

- **Little to learn.** Deskulpt should be easy to learn and use. There should be no need
  to learn a new language or framework to be able to develop desktop widgets. It should
  only require basic knowledge of React and JavaScript (or TypeScript), plus some basic
  configurations to work. If one does not wish to customize widgets themselves and only
  use existing ones, they should be able to do so without any coding knowledge.
- **Performant.** Deskulpt should be lightweight and fast. As a long-running
  application that is designed to sit on your desktop, it should not consume too much
  memory of CPU resources.

## Sinking and Floating

Deskulpt has two basic modes: **sink mode** and **float mode**. This refer to the state
of the canvas, which is essentially a transparent and undecorated window that sits
always below other applications and covers the entire screen. All the widgets are drawn
and rendered on the canvas.

- In sink mode, the canvas can be clicked through, meaning that you can interact with
  your desktop (icons, etc.), but the widgets will not be interactable. They are still
  visible and dynamic, but they cannot respond to your mouse or keyboard events.
- In float mode, the canvas cannot be clicked through, meaning that all widgets will be
  fully interactable, i.e., you can click on them, drag them around, type in text areas,
  etc. However, the desktop will be covered by the canvas, so you cannot interact with
  your desktop.

Note, however, that either in sink or float mode, the Deskulpt canvas will stay under
other applications, meaning that even in float mode, the only thing you cannot interact
with is your desktop but not any other applications. Deskulpt also provides convenient
ways to switch between these two modes, including tray icon and self-defined global
shortcuts.

## Comparison with Similar Products

- [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/): Rainmeter is a very nice-looking desktop
  customization tool for Windows. Contrary to Deskulpt, Rainmeter does not rely on
  webview technology but rather uses Windows native APIs to draw widgets, making it
  even more performant and less resource-consuming than Deskulpt. However, this comes at
  the price of flexibility and ease of development. Rainmeter widgets ("skins") must be
  written in its own language which imposes a learning curve on new users. Moreover,
  since it attempts to provide flexibility for its widgets, the language itself becomes
  quite complex and hard to master. This also limits the customizability of Rainmeter
  widgets, at least not as easily as Deskulpt widgets.

- [Übersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/): Übersicht is a desktop customization
  tool for macOS. It is similar to Deskulpt, in that it uses web technologies for widget
  rendering and allows writing React code for defining widgets. However, it suffers from
  lower performance and higher resource consumption compared to Deskulpt. In particular,
  Deskulpt has faster backend implementation in Rust (including the [SWC-based bundler](https://swc.rs/)),
  and is more optimized regarding memory usage. Moreover, Übersicht suffers from certain
  security issues (e.g., it allows running arbitrary shell commands which is potentially
  dangerous), is known to have bugs and crashes on certain versions of macOS, and has
  not been actively maintainer for a while.

In short, Deskulpt seeks to combine the best of both worlds, seeking for the subtle
balance between performance versus customizability and ease of use.
