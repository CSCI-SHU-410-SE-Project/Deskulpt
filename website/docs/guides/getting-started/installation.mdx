# Installation

Deskulpt is a cross-platform desktop customization tool that is available on all major
desktop platforms. It currently supports:

- Windows (10, 11)
- MacOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Linux (X11, tested on Ubuntu)

You may install the latest release of Deskulpt from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/CSCI-SHU-410-SE-Project/Deskulpt/releases)
or use one of the links below. To build Deskulpt from source, please refer to the
[developer guide](/development/developer-guide/contributing-code#building-from-source).

Note that if you already have Deskulpt installed and wish to install again (e.g., to
update to a newer version), you should **not** clear app data unless you are sure what
you are doing. Clearing app data will remove all your widgets and settings.
