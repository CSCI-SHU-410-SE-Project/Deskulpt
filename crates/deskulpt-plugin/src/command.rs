    /// Other available information include:
    ///
    /// - `id` is the ID of the widget that triggered the command.
    /// - `plugin` provides a reference back to the plugin that the command is
    ///   running on. This is useful when the plugin carries some state that the
    ///   command needs to access.
    /// - `engine` provides an interface for interacting with the Deskulpt
    ///   engine. See [`EngineInterface`] for available methods.
