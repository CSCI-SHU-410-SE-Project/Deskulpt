This is the umbrella crate re-exporting all the sub-crates of Deskulpt. It also adds higher-level APIs for stitching the sub-crates together that are not exposed in the sub-crates themselves.

## ⚠️ Deskulpt Internal Crate

This crate is used internally by the Deskulpt application and is not designed to support plugin authors or other users directly.
