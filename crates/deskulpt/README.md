This is the umbrella crate re-exporting all the sub-crates of Deskulpt. It also adds higher-level APIs for stitching the sub-crates together that are not exposed in the sub-crates themselves.

## ⚠️ Deskulpt Internal Crate

This crate is meant to be used internally by the Deskulpt application and is not designed to support plugin authors or other users directly. Private items are documented for reference of Deskulpt developers.
