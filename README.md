**Deskulpt** is a cross-platform desktop customization tool that allows you to write
React code to define widgets on your desktop. It is powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app/),
and written in Rust and TypeScript.

The project was started in 2024 as a final project for the Software Engineering course
at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). It is currently maintained by the original
authors.

Similar softwares exist ([Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) for Windows,
[Ubersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) for MacOS), but what makes Deskulpt
different is that:

- **Deskulpt is cross-platform.** To the best of our knowledge, Deskulpt is the first
  desktop customization tool that supports all major desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS,
  Linux).

- **Deskulpt is light-weight and memory-safe.** Deskulpt is powered by Tauri, which uses
  Rust as its backend. Tauri provides a more light-weight solution than other existing
  frameworks (e.g. Electron), and Rust guarantees the memory safety of Deskulpt.

Currently, Deskulpt supports the following platforms:

- Windows (10, 11)
- MacOS
- Linux (X11, tested on Ubuntu)
