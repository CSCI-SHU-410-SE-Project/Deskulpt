# Deskulpt

Deskulpt is a cross-platform desktop customization tool that allows you to write TSX / JS code to define widgets on your desktop. It's powered by [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), and written in Rust and TypeScript.

Similar software exists ([Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) for Windows, [Ubersicht](https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) for MacOS). What make Deskulpt different are

- Deskulpt is cross-platform
  To our best knowledget, this is the first desktop customization tool that can run cross-platformly.
- Deskulpt is light-weight and memory-safe.
  It is powered by Tauri, which uses Rust as its backend. Tauri provides a more light-weight solution than existing framework (e.g. Electron), and Rust guarantee the memory safety of Deskulpt.

Currently, Deskulpt supports

- Windows (10, 11)
- MacOS
- Linux, X11 (tested on Ubuntu)
